# TidyMass

TidyMass is a fragmentation tree based mass spectrometry data analysis tool. It calsulates fragmentation trees from mass spectrometry data and assigns the fragment formulas to the peaks in the mass spectrum. After that, the mass spectrum can be represented as a sequence of fragments, which can be used for further analysis.
